# Connect4_with_Additions

**Intelligent Search Algorithms** Task in my Faculty.

The task is to make the **"Connect4"** game in any programming language (I'm using **C#**) without **GUI**, play with it using **Console (Terminal)**, and implement **ISA** to solve **all phases** in it automatically.

In this game I use **Minimax Algorithm** to solve it.

## Connect4 Puzzle

Connect4 is a classic **two-player** game where the objective is to be the first to form a line of four of your colored discs in a grid. 
The game board is typically a 6x7 vertical grid, although variations can exist.

Players take turns dropping one of their colored discs from the top into any of the seven columns.
The disc then falls straight down to the lowest empty space within that column.
The goal is to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of your discs before your opponent does.

The challenge lies in strategically placing your discs to build your own line while also blocking your opponent from creating their line of four. It's a game that requires both offensive and defensive thinking, as each move can influence the board and the possibilities for both players.

The game is straightforward to learn but offers depth in strategy, making it enjoyable for both casual players and those seeking a more strategic challenge.

## Additions to Game

I've added a **'swap'** option where any player can exchange their ball with the other player's, 
and I've also included a **'delete'** feature that allows any player to remove another player's ball.

## To Try It

You need to have **.NET SDK** 8 or higher
